iorn
====

iorn (named after short for I/O runner) is a wrapper library for easy use of
Linux liburing/io_uring.

It is in the very early stage of development, and the API will change in incompatible ways.

## The goal

* Provide an easy-to-use wrapper of liburing for my own usecases.

## The non-goal

* Cover every feature in liburing/io_uring.
* Cross platform with Windows IOCP (I/O comletion port) and FreeBSD kqueue.
